# windows-desktop-switcher
An AutoHotkey script for Windows that lets a user change virtual desktops by pressing WIN + MouseWhell or other custom key combination. It also provides other features, such as creation/deletion of desktops by hotkey, etc. (see Hotkeys section below).

## Overview
This script creates more convenient hotkeys for switching virtual desktops in Windows 10. I built this to better mirror the mapping I use on linux (with dwm), and it's always annoyed me that Windows does not have better hotkey support for this feature (for instance, there's no way to go directly to a desktop by number).

Note, CapsLock will function normally even when using it as a modifier.

## Running
[Install AutoHotkey](https://autohotkey.com/download/) v1.1 or later, then run the `desktop_switcher.ahk` script (open with AutoHotkey if prompted). 

## Default Hotkeys
        <WIN> + MouseWhell UP   - Switch to virtual desktop on left
        <WIN> + MouseWhell UP   - Switch to virtual desktop on right
